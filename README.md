# Gaining ALL items in BLoxd

Copy and Paste the code in ```wordcode.js``` to your world code. 

Type the command ```/all```, this would make the script start scanning for blocks and items. The blocks would be added to the Workbench while the items would be added to the Artisan Bench.

Wait untill it is finished. A text would pop out on your in-game screen to notify you.

You can then use ```/stats``` to check the quantitative data regarding the loaded blocks and items.

##### IMPORTANT NOTE! You need to have a stone in inventory to "craft" items and blocks, and you need to throw the crafted "illegal" blocks on the ground and then pick up to be able to ACTUALLY place it.

## Note: Banned List

The banend list contains substrings that the program filters out to reduce the amount of repetitive items.

Use ```/bannedlist``` to check currently banned substrings.

Use ```/bannedlist add [string]``` to add a substring to banned list

Use ```/bannedlist remove [index]``` to remove a substring at that index (index starts at 1)

Use ```/bannedlist restore``` restores banned list to original
